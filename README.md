# Attack of the Clowns

Attack of the Clowns is an in-browser game written using vanilla JavaScript. This game was created as part of the [Roll the Dice Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/roll-the-dice-game-jam). The rules for this game jam are as follows:

> In this game jam, you will be working with random generators to determine what game concept you will be working on. You will choose one or more of the listed generators below and work on your game based on the the results. When you post your final result, please describe what your random results were so everyone is aware what your working off of. Because there's no way to verify whether you used any of the generators and this game jam is meant to be fun, an honor system will be implemented. I hope you look at this as an opportunity to make something fun, bizarre and unique rather than to defeat others.

Submissions are due April 27th 2019 at 12:00 PM.
